    "- They can query the database as many times as needed to answer the user question.\n",
    "- They can recover from errors by running a generated query, catching the traceback and regenerating it correctly.\n",
    "- They can answer questions based on the databases' schema as well as on the databases' content (like describing a specific table).\n"
